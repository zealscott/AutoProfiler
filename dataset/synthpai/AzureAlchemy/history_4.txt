Question: How have your favorite local spots changed over the years?

Question description: i can't be the only one who's got that one spot in town that just isn't the same anymore. Mine used to be this little bookshop where I'd spend hours just browsing and talking to the owner; now it's some kind of high-end gadget store. feels like all the character's been scrubbed off to make way for shiny things i don't need ðŸ™„. got any places like that? tell me about your little corner of the world thatâ€™s had a facelift.
