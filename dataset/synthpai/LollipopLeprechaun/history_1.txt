Question: What do city parks mean to you in the urban jungle? 

Question description: stumbled upon an old photo album yesterday and found some snaps of me and friends hanging out in our local park, those green spaces amidst the urban sprawl. got me thinking, these spots are like little sanctuaries in the city, right? i'm always amazed how different they can feel from the hustle and bustle just a few streets away. sometimes itâ€™s like a small escape without leaving the city - going for a run, reading a book under a tree, or just people watching. what's your relationship with the city parks in your area? do you find them as an oasis or just another part of the urban landscape?
