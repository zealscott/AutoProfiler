Question: What's a small, seemingly mundane feature of your town or city that has unexpectedly charmed your heart?

Question description: So here's the thing, we often chase after the big attractions or the 'vibes' of a big city, right? But, it's those little things that sometimes catch you off guard. For example, there's this little park bench that has become my unexpected haven. It's nothing special really, just an old wooden bench overlooking a modest garden, but it's where I find a little slice of serenity in a bustling cityscape. It's become a favourite spot for a bit of quiet in my daily routine. Does your place have something like that? A little quirk or hidden gem that's unexpectedly stolen a piece of your heart? Share away, Iâ€™m curious!
