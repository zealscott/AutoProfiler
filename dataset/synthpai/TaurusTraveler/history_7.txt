Question: What's been your experience with the cafe culture boom in your city?

Question description: so i've noticed this wild explosion of thematic cafes and cozy little coffee spots sprouting like mushrooms after the rain around these corners. feels like you can't walk a block without bumping into a new spot with freshly-ground coffee aroma wafting through the air, old-school vinyl crackling in the background, or some high-concept ambient design vibe. gone are the days when our local cafe scene was just a couple of known joints. friend of mine joked, "are we preparing for an epidemic of writers or what?" lol. but honestly, it's kinda nice to have those spots where you can chill, study or work with your laptop or just enjoy a good book y'know? how about your neck of the woods? experiencing the same cafe culture spree or nah?
