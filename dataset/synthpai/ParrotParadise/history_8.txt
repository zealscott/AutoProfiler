Question: What's the most creative side hustle you've started due to your main income not stretching far enough?

Question description: ya know, with life being as pricey as it is, my main gig's salary is kinda like trying to cover a king-sized bed with a twin blanket. So, I've started doing some freelance coding projects on the side. It's nothing fancy, just here and there helping some folks with their website backend stuff. Curious, though - ever found yourself in a spot where the paychecks felt a bit too thin and you hustled up a creative way to stack some extra coins? What's the side gig you're most proud of, or the one that turned out to be surprisingly fun or lucrative? Share your tales of turning tight budgets into tight strategies!
