Question: Urban Gardening: Have you turned any tiny space into a green oasis?

Question description: as someone who's super into agricultural sciences (yeah, bit of a plant geek here), i've been experimenting with growing my own veggies on my tiny balcony. tbh, it's a refreshing escape from the concrete jungle life. managed to get some tomatoes and herbs thriving amongst the hustle of commuters and honking cars. feels like a little victory, you know? curious if anyone else has tried this urban gardening thing and what kinda green magic you've been able to conjure up in your own nook of the world?
