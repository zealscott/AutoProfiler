Question: How do you manage to keep life fulfilling with a modest income in an increasingly expensive world?

Question description: so just scrolling through my news feed and checking all those fancy new gadgets and vacations spots can sometimes be a bit too much, right? kinda makes me nostalgic for simpler timesâ€¦ anyway, my friends and i were talking about how living on a tight budget can actually lead to some pretty creative living. it's almost like a game sometimes, trying to find the best deals or come up with new ways to have fun without breaking the bank. i've even got into gardening, believe it or not, helps with the grocery bills and it's kinda therapeutic. how do you guys make the most of things when money's tight? got any life hacks or feel-good stories to share about thriving on a shoestring?
