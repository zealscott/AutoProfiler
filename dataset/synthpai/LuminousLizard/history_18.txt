Question: Redditors, what unexpected situations have you encountered due to assumptions about your gender? 

Question description: had a good chuckle the other day at a local market - someone approached me offering to help with some heavy bags, assuming I might need a hand. It was sweet but also got me thinking how often we jump to conclusions based on gender. Back in my school days, I was the one climbing the ladder to fix things in the classroom, and my male colleague was the master at soothing the upset kiddosâ€”which always surprised new staff. What's your own story of being in a situation where someone's assumption about gender roles turned out to be way off the mark?
