Question: How does what you earn match up with the life you thought you'd have growing up?

Question description: so i was crunching numbers (typical day, ya know?), and started thinking about how we all had those wild dreams as kids about what our lives would look like. Picturing fancy cars, traveling all the time, or maybe just having a killer gaming setup. Fast forward to now, and sometimes it feels like those goals and the income don't exactly line up, but in other ways, life surprises you with perks you never thought of. How's reality treating you compared to those childhood daydreams? Are you where you thought you'd be, or has life thrown a curveball of surprises your way?
