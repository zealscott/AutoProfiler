Question: How do you handle financial peaks and valleys throughout the year?

Question description: Yo Redditors! I've noticed we don't often chat about the rollercoaster ride our bank accounts can take, especially with those unexpected expenses or seasonal income changes. I gotta say, despite being kinda savvy with numbers, balancing the books at home can still throw me for a loop. Case in point - had a side hustle that paid well during the holidays, but now we're in the lull period, I find myself doing mental gymnastics to keep it all smooth. Wondering - how do y'all manage these ups and downs? Any wild stories or solid tips to share?
