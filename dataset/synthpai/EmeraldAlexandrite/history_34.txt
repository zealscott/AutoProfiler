Question: In what unexpected ways has your partner influenced your hobbies and interests?

Question description: I never imagined I'd be one for gardening until my SO basically turned our backyard into a mini botanical haven. It's weird how you start picking up bits and pieces from each other's passions. Now I'm out there more than they are, fighting snails and talking to plants lol. Got me wondering, have any of you had a similar kind of crossover with your partner's hobbies? How has it turned out for you?
