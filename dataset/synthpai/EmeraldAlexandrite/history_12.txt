Question: Redditors, how has your perception of a "good income" changed as you've progressed in your career or life stages?

Question description: Gotta say, the concept of a 'good income' is tricky, it's like chasing a king-size chocolate bar that grows every time you take a bite. Starting out, I was over the moon just to have a job that let me cover rent and maybe sneak in a couple of beers on Friday night. But as the years zoom, the bar for what's 'enough' keeps getting set higher â€“ saving for a house, planning for a fam, and let's not even talk about trying to have a decent vacay without the budget blues hitting you. I'm curious, have you folks felt that shift in gears too? Has what you consider a comfy income changed? Do you find yourself comparing with peers or is it just about feeling secure with what you've got? Let's spill the beans.
