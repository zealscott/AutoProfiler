Question: Redditors, have you ever felt like your birthplace has a "personality" that's stayed with you no matter where you go? 

Question description: i was thinking about how the vibe of the city i was born in (a coastal spot known for its laid-back atmosphere and colorful streets) kinda imprinted on me from a young age. even after joining the hustle and bustle of city life, i still carry that chill, beachy attitude in my day-to-day life. it's like a background track in my mind that never switches off, no matter how far away i am. does this happen to you guys too? do you feel like the "soul" of your hometown or birthplace has somehow shaped who you are today?
