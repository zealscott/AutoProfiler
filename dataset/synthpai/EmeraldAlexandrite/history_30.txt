Question description: Soo.. lately i’ve been realizing that ever since I tied the knot, my gaming nights with buddies have drastically reduced and instead, i’m exploring things I never thought I would - like, say, salsa dancing. Guess you could say love makes you do new stuff, right? Or in some cases maybe drop some hobbies? How about you folks, noticed any shifts in your pastime pursuits post relationship status change?
