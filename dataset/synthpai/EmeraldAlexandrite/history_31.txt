Question: Partners of Redditors, how has your S.O. surprised you in ways that showed they really know you? 

Question description: Just realized how much my partner actually pays attention to the little things about me. Recently on a quiet weekend, they totally caught me off-guard with a day planned solely around my kind of fun. We're talking about a marathon of my favorite cheesy movies, my preferred snacks, and even a board game that I mentioned liking months ago! Blew my mind and it wasn't even my birthday or anything. It got me thinking, there must be heaps of stories where partners just nail it with the little things. What's your 'they really know me' moment?
