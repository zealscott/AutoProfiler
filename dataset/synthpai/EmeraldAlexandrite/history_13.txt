Question: Was your degree worth it, given where you are now in life? Reflecting on your education and current job, do you feel content or contemplate what-if scenarios?

Question description: So I was crunching numbers the other day for a routine budget forecast (glamorous, I know), and I caught myself daydreaming about the ‘what-ifs’. Started thinking about my time in college – late night study sessions, cramming tax regulations, and all that jazz – and wondered if it all panned out like I hoped? I mean, I'm doing alright, but there's always that curiosity, y'know? Maybe I could’ve been a wildlife photographer or a chef. But hey, enough about me getting whimsical. What’s your story? Looking back to your college days, you reckon you made the right call? Tell me about where you're at vs where you thought you'd be.
