Question: How do you think your perception of "adulthood" has changed as you've gotten closer to it or as you've moved through it?

Question description: So I was chatting with some friends the other day, reminiscing about how as kids, we thought being in your 30s meant being super established - you know, career, family, house, the whole nine yards. Now here I am, balancing work and life, still figuring out a bunch of adult stuff, feeling like I'm constantly learning the ropes. Feels like that 'established adult' goalpost keeps moving. Anyone else find that their view of adulthood changed big time once they were in the thick of it? What's your take on this whole adulting business?
