Question: How does the cost of living affect your lifestyle choices in your area?

Question description: i’ve noticed lately how my spending habits have shifted a lot depending on where I'm at – when the prices of daily goods climb up, it's like my hobbies, and even the way I socialize, have to adapt. it's kinda wild, like, do I go out this weekend or save up for that impending car service? and then there's rent, don't even get me started. does anyone else feel this juggle is more like a circus act, or is it just me feeling the pinch? how do you balance the budget with fun in your neck of the woods?
