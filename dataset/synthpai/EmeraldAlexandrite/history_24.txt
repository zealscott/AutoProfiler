Question: How has traditional gender norms affected your career or education choices?

Question description: ya know, growing up, it always felt like there was this silent pressure to fit into what was expected of me ‘cause of my gender. my mates and i would joke about it, but deep down we all kinda felt the squeeze, ya know? I remember considering careers that seemed to be more 'appropriate' for guys back in the day. it's fascinating, right? so how about y’all? did these norms nudge you into or away from certain paths in life? Share your stories, keen to hear 'em!
