Question: How has your perception of gender roles in society changed since your childhood?

Question description: back in the day, we had these really rigid ideas of what guys and gals were supposed to do and be like. i remember feeling sort of out of place cause i wasn't into all that stereotypical "manly" stuff, like sports or cars. instead, i was happier with numbers and a calm evening at home, which seemed to confuse the heck out of my football-loving dad. fast forward to now, and it seems like things are changing, with more acceptance for different expressions of gender and whatnot. i'm curious - have you seen a shift in how gender roles are viewed where you're from? any personal stories of breaking the mold?
