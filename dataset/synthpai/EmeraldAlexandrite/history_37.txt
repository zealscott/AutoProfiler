Question: What's a hidden local gem from your childhood place that you think nobody else knows?

Question description: Growing up there was this little cave by the shore that pretty much no one knew about except the kids from my neighborhood. It was the ultimate hangout spot for us, sorta our own little world. Ended up going back there recently and it's pretty much unchanged, still a hidden spot amidst the hustle. Got me wondering, do any of you have a place like that from where you grew up? Some cool, quirky or secret spot that holds special memories but might not be on Google maps or in the tourist guides?
