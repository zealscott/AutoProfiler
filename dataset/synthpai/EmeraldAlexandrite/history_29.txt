Question: How have your expectations of being a 'man' or 'woman' changed as you have gotten older?

Question description: I was chatting with some friends from varsity the other day about the pressures and expectations we used to feel about 'being a man.' The stuff we worried about, and the stereotypes we thought we had to live up to seem kinda outdated now, but I'm sure everyone's got their own take based on their experiences. For myself, I've stopped stressing over some of the traditional roles and started focusing on what makes me, y'know, actually happy. So, what's your story? How have your views on your gender role evolved over the years?
