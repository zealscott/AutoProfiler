Question: Does your career align with traditional gender expectations, and how does that influence your workplace dynamics?

Question description: always find it fascinating to think about the jobs ancestors probably did. Me, I ended up crunching numbers which I guess fits the 'stereotype' for dudes back in the day. However, I've noticed a shift, and my department is pretty much a 50/50 split gender-wise. Got me thinking about how careers aren't so gendered anymore. But still, with some friends, I see they get a different vibe in their jobs due to traditional gender roles â€“ either being the odd one out or feeling pressure to 'fit the mold'. What's your scene like at work? Do you see traditional gender expectations influencing your roles, responsibilities or how you're treated?
