Question: What's something you expected to have figured out by your age but definitely haven't?

Question description: yo peeps, so here's the thing, i kinda always thought that by the time i was pushing 40, i'd have all my ducks in a row – finances crystal clear, life plan on lockdown, the works. Don’t get me wrong, things are steady but man, the more years I stack, the more I feel like there's a secret adulting manual everyone got but me. The other day I was sorting my tax stuff (thrilling, I know) and it hit me – I’m still winging it in so many areas. It’s like everyone around me is acing this life thing, and I’m here just tryna not get a paper cut from life’s instructions manual, you get me? Anyway, I’m curious, what’s something you thought you’d have totally figured out by now, but just... don’t? Do share your stories, make a guy feel less like he's riding solo on the struggle bus.
