Question: How does your career choice correlate with your lifestyle aspirations? Are you living it up, just getting by, or planning for a switch?

Question description: Been crunching numbers daily and it's funny how I find myself budgeting life outside work almost like an excel sheet. Sometimes it makes me wonder if I naturally fell into my career because I'm wired this way, or if the job molded my personal finance habits. Definitely provides comfortably, but adventure's calling, maybe a sabbatical's due. What's your story - does your job sync with your dream lifestyle or are you plotting a grand escape?
