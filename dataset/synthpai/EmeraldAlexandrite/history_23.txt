history 23
Question: In your culture, how does turning 30 change the way society views you and your responsibilities?

Question description: been thinkin' lately about how much weight certain ages carry in society's eyes. hit the 3-0 not long back, and suddenly fam's all about when's the house coming, where are the kiddos, and let's talk more about those long-term investment plans. it's like crossing some invisible finish line into 'adulthood: the serious edition'. got me curious about how it's for others, how big of a deal is the dirty thirty (or any age milestone really) in your neck of the woods? do people start looking at you differently or expect different things from you?
