Question: What’s an unexpected upside of your city that you’ve grown to love?

Question description: so im usually someone who enjoys the quiet suburban life, but due to work, I find myself in the hustle and bustle more often than not. realized there's something kinda magical about those hidden pockets of calm amidst the chaos - you know, those quirky little parks or indie bookstores that become your sanctuary. and there's something about the energy and diversity that's just infectious. despite my love for tranquility, the city's vibe is growing on me. what about you folks? discovered any surprising gems or aspects of your city that you've come to appreciate?
