Question: What’s the strangest “local legend” or urban myth in your area that turned out to be true or had some truth to it?

Question description: I grew up hearing stories about a supposedly "haunted" building in the heart of the city. Everyone would say it's just old wives' tales until a few years back, a renovation project actually dug up some pretty eerie stuff from its basement – I'm talking real historical artifacts that were better suited for a museum than an office block. From that point, those tales didn't seem so laughable. Got me thinking about the gems hidden in plain sight and the truth behind urban myths. What bizarre stories from your area eventually ended up having a hint of truth in them?
