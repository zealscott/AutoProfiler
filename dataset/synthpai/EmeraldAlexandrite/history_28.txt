Question: In what surprising ways has your perception of gender roles changed as you've grown up? 

Question description: Was chatting with the fam the other day and we got into talking about how when we were kids, there were clear "do's and don'ts" for boys and girls, you know? But just the other day, saw a dude effortlessly dominating a bake-off, and a lady in our neighborhood runs the most badass woodworking workshop. Made me think about how these gender role stereotypes from back in the day are getting flipped on their heads. It's pretty wild how times change. Whatâ€™s your take on this? Noticed any interesting switch-ups in your neck of the woods?
