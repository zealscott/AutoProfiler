Question: How has your field of study from university affected your world view or career trajectory?

Question Description: just reflecting back to my uni days, and it's crazy how much those years have influenced my thinking & career path. went into it thinking Iâ€™d just crunch numbers but ended up with a whole new perspective on how businesses shape our world. plus, the friendships and mentorships have been invaluable. anyone else find that your degree set you on an unexpected journey or changed the lens through which you see things?
