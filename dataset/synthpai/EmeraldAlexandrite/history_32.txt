Question: Has the "7 Year Itch" in relationships been true for you, or just a myth? 

Question description: So I've been hearing about the "7 Year Itch" – that idea that around seven years into a relationship or marriage, things start getting a little stale or partners become restless. Been hitched for a bit now and I've noticed some of my mates hitting that point and either doubling down or decking out. Makes me wonder if there's some universal truth to it or it's just another one of those old wives' tales. What's your take on this? Ever found yourself getting twitchy feet around the 7-year mark, or does that sound like a load of hogwash? Share your stories – itching for the insight!
