Question: What's one thing you've done that completely challenged traditional gender roles and how did it feel?

Question description: Alright, so i was having a convo with a friend and we got onto the topic of all the traditional gender role stuff. you know, like guys fixing cars and women baking cookies. old school, right? but then it got me thinking about all the times we step out of those roles and do something completely different. like, i'm not exactly the handiest fella with tools, but i recently took a pottery class, which is mostly chicks, and guess what... i absolutely LOVED it. it was super chill and my wife digs the new plant pots i made. felt kinda empowering breakin' the mold, ya know? So, how about you guys n gals? ever done something that's not "typical" for your gender and how did that go for you? Share the deeds! 🚀🔧🍪
