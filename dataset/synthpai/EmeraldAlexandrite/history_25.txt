Question: How has the dynamic of breadwinning changed in your household from previous generations to now? 

Question description: Yo, I've noticed some cool shifts in my circle where traditional roles are getting all mixed up. My buddy, for example, is staying home with the kids while his wife is crushing it in her career, and I think that's pretty dope. It's a bit of a switch from our parents' vibe. Got me thinking â€“ anyone else seeing changes in who's bringing home the bacon? Who's doing the 9 to 5 or the stay-at-home gig? Share your stories, I'm keen to hear how it's playing out in different households.
