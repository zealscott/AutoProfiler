Question: What's a deeply ingrained local custom from your childhood place that's stuck with you wherever you go?

Question description: I remember back in the day, the kite battles we had were epic! You'd spend weeks prepping your kite for the showdown and every rip in the sky felt like a personal victory. Now, while the battles might have stayed back in my memory lane, I still find myself teaching every interested kid in the park how to make a kite that can hold its own â€” it's like passing on a piece of my past. Does anyone else have some quirky or cool tradition from their childhood haunts that they can't seem to shake off, no matter where you are now?
