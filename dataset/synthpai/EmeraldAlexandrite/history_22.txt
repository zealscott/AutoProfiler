Question: What's one thing from your childhood that shaped your views on gender roles, and do you still carry those views today?

Question description: i remember when i was a kid, i loved baking with my mom while my old man always pushed me to "get outside and do something manly". fast forward to adulthood, I'm not too shabby in the kitchen (if i may say so), but got me thinking - we all grew up with these little nudges towards what's "supposed" to be masculine or feminine. some of us stick to it, others break free. what about you folks? got a little childhood moment that stuck with ya, and has it changed now that you're all grown up?
