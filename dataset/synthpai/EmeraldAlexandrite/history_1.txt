Question: Redditors, ever been startled by how much a childhood spot changed when you visited it after years?

Question description: the other day i walked by the park where I used to spend like every weekend as a kid and man, it was nothing like i remembered. we used to bike like crazy over there and there was this ice cream truck always parked right outside... Now it's got this fancy coffee kiosk and way too many yoga mats if you ask me. Kinda cool but also a bit sad? Got me thinking about how we all remember these places from when we were younger... and then reality hits you with the update. So what’s your 'this isn’t how I left it' story about a place from your youth?
