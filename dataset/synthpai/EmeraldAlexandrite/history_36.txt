Question: Redditors, how does the city you were born in shape the person you are today?

Question description: funny enough, i’ve always felt a strong connection to the ocean, not just for the chill beach vibes but like, deep in my soul, y’know? might be because i popped into this world within a stone’s throw of the ocean. every time i head back, it feels like i'm tethered to the waves, the smell of salt air kinda resets everything for me. pretty wild how our birthplaces stick with us like that. does the city where you first saw the light of day still echo in your life choices, your personality, or even your preferences?
