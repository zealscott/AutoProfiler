Question: How has the concept of masculinity or femininity influenced your career or professional choices?

Question description: been pondering about how "traditional" gender roles have shaped our career paths. i remember when i was younger, feeling kinda boxed into what was expected of me as a guy when picking my field, which is pretty numbers-heavy (let's just say taxes are involved). but i've witnessed some mates completely break those expectations, diving into gigs traditionally dominated by the opposite gender, and killin' it! got me curiousâ€”have these norms nudged you towards or away from a particular profession? any of you zigged when society expected you to zag?
