Question: How did your degree shape your perspective on your job versus the actual workplace realities?

Question description: So after grinding out a degree, I thought I had it all figured out. Numbers, spreadsheets, financial models - you name it! But stepping into the job market, I discovered there's a whole world of work politics, soft skills and unwritten rules that no textbook ever taught me. Suddenly, it's less about knowing it all, and more about navigating complex office terrains. Sometimes I feel a bit like a fish out of water, but adapting is key, right? How about you folks, any stories where your degree left you prepared (or unprepared) for the real world of work?
