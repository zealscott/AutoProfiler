Question: How does the city you were born in shape your identity and storytelling?

Question description: isn't it wild how the place we first opened our eyes can weave itself into our essence without us even noticing? like, for instance, i have a pal who grew up by the sea, and no matter where he goes, he's gotta find his way back to the water, his stories are always bound to the rhythm of the waves. and then there's me, with a hometown that's nestled between mountains and ocean - it's kinda left me with this love for diverse landscapes and a taste for adventure that sneaks into my tales. so, Iâ€™m curious, does your birthplace sneak into your identity? how does your hometown background sneak into your conversations or the stories you tell?
