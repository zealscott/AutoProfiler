Question: Millennials and Gen Z's, what "old school" skills have you learned that you're unexpectedly proud of? 

Question description: Was talking to a buddy and we realized that despite being pretty techy, some of us still dig learning things our parents were pros at. Like, I've recently got super into doing taxes by hand (weird flex, I know) and even my SO is getting a kick out of old-school cooking from scratch. It's like, the more we're glued to screens, the more doing something tangible feels kinda badass. Anyone else find themselves oddly proud of picking up a skill that's considered outdated in our digital world?
