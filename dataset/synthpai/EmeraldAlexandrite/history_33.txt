Question: In the age of limitless connections, how has your relationship status influenced your life choices and experiences?

Question description: i've always wondered how much of the big decisions in life are swayed by our relationship status. Like, I've got a mate who moved halfway across the country for love, whereas another friend of mine turned down a dream job offer just so they wouldn't have to do long distance. For myself, winding up in a serious relationship kinda changed my weekend warrior plans into more of a suttle stay-at-home vibe, and honestly, it's been great. But enough about me, what's your story? How has being single, coupled up, or something more complicated shaped your life's path and the opportunities you've jumped at or passed on?
