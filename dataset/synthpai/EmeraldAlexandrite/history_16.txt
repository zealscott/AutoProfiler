Question: People who 'fell into' their professions, are you happy or do you wish you pursued your passion?

Question description: it's weird, growing up i always thought I'd be doing something with more... I dunno, adventure? maybe out in nature or travelling a lot. but somewhere along the way, i got good with numbers and just kinda floated into the finance zone without really planning to. some days i'm crunching numbers and i'm like 'yep, this is solid' but then i got days where i'm dreaming about what-ifs. anyone out there ended up somewhere they never expected? how's that working out for you?
