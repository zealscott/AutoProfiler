Question: For those who’ve moved cities, what weird or unexpected “culture shocks” have you experienced even within your own country?

Question description: so i took this leap a while back, moved from my birthplace to chase better career opportunities. i won't drop names, but let's just say from the coast to a big-business hub. boy, was it an adventure! the first thing i noticed was the way people here treat a bbq. where i’m from, it’s a whole-day, flip-flops, shorts, and bring-your-dog kinda affair. here, it’s more of a ‘scheduled program’ and way less casual. i once rocked up at 3 pm thinking it was starting just to find i missed the 'main event' at 1! have any of you experienced little quirks and oddities that threw you off when you moved cities, despite staying within the same country?
