Question: People of Reddit, what's a peculiar local habit or tradition in your area that visitors often find surprising? 

Question description: you ever notice how every place has its own quirks that just seem to baffle outsiders? In my line of work, I meet folks from all over, and it's hilarious to see their reactions to some of our local customs. Like the other day, I picked up this guy who was genuinely shocked that we actually have a day where we celebrate our love for a certain orange root vegetable. I mean, it's bizarre but it's tradition, right? Makes me wonder what kind of wacky traditions exist in other corners of the globe. So, what's a unique tradition from your neck of the woods that throws visitors for a loop?
