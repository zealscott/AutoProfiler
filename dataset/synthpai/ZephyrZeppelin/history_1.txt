Question: What are the unique challenges of commuting in your city, and how do you tackle them?

Question description: the daily grind of getting to work is like a puzzle where the pieces don't always fit - especially when your main modes of transport involve a combo of trains, buses, or even boats. just like in my own morning conquering quest, I always end up with stories that range from the heartwarming to the hilariously absurd. like, this one time I was crammed in a bus so full I think I became a temporary contortionist! what's your commuting saga? got any tips or epic tales to share from your city's rush hour rodeos?
