Question: What are some unexpected "perks" of where you're living that outsiders might not know about?

Question description: so every place has got its famous stuff, right? like theaters, restaurants, that one big park... but i've noticed there's a lot cooler, under the radar type benefits that you only really get to know by actually living in a place. found this amazing little community garden the other day right when I thought I knew all the nooks of my neighborhood - a true hidden gem that never gets overcrowded. got me wondering, what are some lesser-known "perks" of your area that a tourist guide won't tell you about?
