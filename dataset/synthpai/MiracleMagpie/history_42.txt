Question: How do you navigate traditional gender expectations in your career or daily life?

Question description: so ive been thinking a lot about gender roles lately, and how they play out in different scenarios, especially at work. i manage events for a living, which has its fair share of expectations - some might say its a 'feminine' gig, but I've met plenty of dudes killing it in this field too. got me wondering how others handle the whole traditional gender role thing in their professional lives or just day-to-day stuff. stay true to yourself, bend a little to fit in, told you can't do something 'cause it's not 'typical' for your gender? share some stories y'all, curious minds want to know!
