Question: Does your degree define your career, or have you taken a different path post-graduation?

Question description: I always thought that what I studied would be my career for life. But after diving deep into my field, I found myself curious about different things that were not even remotely related to my masters. Met a guy at a cafe who studied marine biology and now runs a successful app development firm. It's fascinating how our journeys twist and turn. So, what's your story? Did your degree set your trajectory, or did you veer off into another realm altogether? Share your tale!
