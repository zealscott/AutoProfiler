Question: As urban dwellers, do you feel the relentless pace of the city is shaping or draining you? 

Question description: i keep finding myself caught up in the fast-paced rhythm of daily life where i am, always hustling from one project to the next, barely having a minute to slowdown. sometimes I get this buzz out of it, feel like I'm riding a wave - but other days it's just exhausting. the skyline's always changing here too, new buildings sprouting up like mushrooms overnight! everything's in a constant state of flux. what about you? are you energized by the never-ending motion around you, or do you find yourself seeking an escape hatch every now and then?
