Question: How have your ambitions and priorities shifted as you've aged?

Question description: ya know, back in college i was all about landing a dream job and traveling the world, ticking off every country on my bucket list. Now, a bit more into adulthood, i find myself drawn to creating a cozy home environment and learning new cooking recipes rather than hopping on a plane. Also, the idea of stability has a whole new meaning to me. Anyone else noticing shifts in what you're chasing after with every candle added to the birthday cake?
