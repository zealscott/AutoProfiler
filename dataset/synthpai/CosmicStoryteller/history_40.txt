Question: For those who chose to stay single, has your perspective on dating and relationships changed over time?

Question description: so my friends and i were havin this chat the other nite about how some of us who are single by choice seem to b more content as we get older. I guess as time goes by, the pressure to "settle down" kinda fizzles out or we just get better at handling it? Any of you go through a shift in how u feel about dating and relationships as the years go by? Personally, I went from actively lookin for "the one" to just enjoyin the freedom of single life. what about you guys?
