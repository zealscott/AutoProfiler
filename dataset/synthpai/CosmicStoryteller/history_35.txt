Question: Do you think modern dating has more advantages for a specific gender, and why or why not?

Question description: okay so, been in the dating game for a bit now and can't help but notice how different it is for my guy friends compared to my girlfriends. like, one of my dudes gets swiped left all day and one of my girl pals gets more matches than there are bikes in our city streets! but i know it ain't all black and white. got me thinking about how the game is played differently and what's really going on. what's your take on this? does one side have it easier or is the grass just greener? share your epic wins, funny fails or just your two cents!
