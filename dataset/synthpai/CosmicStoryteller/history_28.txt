Question: What's the craziest thing you've had to "MacGyver" at your job because you didn't have the right tools or materials?

Question description: so today at work i had to present a model to a client and half way through i realized a piece was missing (big yikes) ended up using some gum and a pen cap to keep it together - no one knew. worked out in the end but had me thinking, sometimes you gotta get pretty creative on the spot, right? what's your best "MacGyver" moment at work where you just had to make do with what you had?
