Question: What unexpected turn did your career take and how did it affect your personal life?

Question description: I remember back when I was in school, aiming for one thing but ended up in a totally different field, it feels like it was almost by accident. Like, I've always been into design, but ended up specializing in a way that life in the office is way more consulting and troubleshooting than creating those big, dreamy projects. Met a lot of interesting peeps 'cause of this unexpected shift though, even if my days are now more about solving puzzles than painting skies. Any of you guys had your career paths take an unexpected detour that kinda reshaped your day-to-day or the way you chill after clocking out?
