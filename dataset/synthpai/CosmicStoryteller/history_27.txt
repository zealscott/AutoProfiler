Question: Ever felt like your degree was a wild card in your career? How did it play out?

Question description: Almost a decade ago, I took a pretty big leap of faith with my master's degree, thinking it would lead me straight to my dream job. Fast forward through years of unexpected twists, turns, and a mad dash through a maze of design challenges—it’s honestly been a ride with more loops than I had on my blueprint! Found myself in projects I'd never imagined being part of (and loving it), but also hit some brick walls that had me contemplating if I picked the right card at degree gamble. Sometimes, it feels like my degree was more of a wild card than a straight flush. Ever felt your field of study threw you a curveball in your career? How did your gamble with education play out in the real world?
