Question: Redditors, do you feel like your hometown's culture has shaped who you are today?

Question description: been thinking a lot about roots and how they tie into our identities - like, growing up, there was this one bustling market in my city where you could hear like three languages at once, smell a crazy mix of spices and dumplings... it was chaotic but somehow it worked. that place was so vibrant, it kinda taught me to be open to new experiences and find harmony in diversity. wondering if you guys feel like your hometown - its culture, vibe, people - has left a mark on your personality or the way you see life?
