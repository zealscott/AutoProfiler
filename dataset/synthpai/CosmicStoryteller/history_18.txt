Question: How has your perception of "the right age" for major life milestones changed as you've gotten older?

Question description: Back in the day, I remember hearing about these 'ideal' ages for hitting certain life goals â€“ you know, stuff like having a career on track by 25, maybe owning property by 30, and the typical timelines for marriage or even starting a family. Fast forward to now, and my view on this is completely different. Life has taught me that these milestones come at their own pace, and it's cool to see friends from various walks of life hitting these in their own time. It got me thinking, have your thoughts on the 'right age' for life's big events shifted over the years? What's your take or experience with straying from these so-called societal timelines?
