Question: How do you navigate traditional gender expectations in your profession, and have they changed over time?

Question description: as someone in a male-dominated field, it's always interesting to me how the gender dynamic in workplace is shifting (or isn't). found that more and more women are entering and really shaking things up! but in some meetings, i can still be the only woman there, which is wild. feels like sometimes you're balancing on a tightrope trying to be "one of the guys" but also true to yourself, ya know? curious to hear about your experiences â€“ any moments where you've felt a shift or had to deal with some outdated norms in your career?
