Question: Has your profession ever challenged the traditional gender roles in your society? 

Question description: So I'm in a field that's always been kinda heavy on guys, but lately I've seen a lot more diversity which is neat. Used to be that if you told someone you were doing my gig, they'd assume a lot about you, y'know? But a while back, I had a conversation with a friend in a whole different line of work, and it turns out they've seen a shift too. Got me thinking about how this whole gender role thing plays out in different jobs. Have you guys noticed changes in the traditional gender balances in your professions, and how's that affecting things?
