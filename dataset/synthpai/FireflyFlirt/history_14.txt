Question: How has your perspective on "the one" changed as you've gotten older? 

Question description: Back in my uni days, I always had this fairy tale idea of "the one" happening like in a rom-com â€“ you know, unexpected coffee spills leading to eyes meeting and bam! Instant connection. But now, after a few steep learning curves, my thoughts are like maybe "the one" is just a myth? Or maybe it's not this magical thing but more like someone you vibe with who's willing to put up with you when you're hangry? Recently got engaged and gotta say, it feels right, but boyyy did we work through some stuff to get here. Wondering how growing up and getting more 'life' under your belt has changed your take on this. Anyone else had their views on love evolve over time?
