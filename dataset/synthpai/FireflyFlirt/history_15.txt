Question: How did the town where you were born shape who you are today?

Question description: I've always found it fascinating how our birthplaces can leave such a mark on us. Stuff like local customs, the accent, or even the high school you went to can really stick, right? I realized that I still carry a bit of my hometown's love for seafaring tales and amber art, even though I moved away years ago. Made me wonder â€“ what are some things from your birthplace that you carry with you, and do you think they've shaped your personality or your life choices in noticeable ways?
