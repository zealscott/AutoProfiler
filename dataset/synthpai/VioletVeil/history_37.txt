history 37
i stuck pretty close to my degree actually! always had a thing for designs & creating spaces where stories unfold 🏡 sure sometimes i think 'bout changing lanes but guess i'm happiest shaping city skylines & cozy nooks ☕ might not sound as wild as swapping marine bio for app development but hey stability has its own kind of charm ya know? 🌆
