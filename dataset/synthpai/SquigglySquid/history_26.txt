Question: Redditors who've witnessed their hometown become 'famous' or 'infamous', what's your story, and how do you feel about it? 

Question description: Have you ever thought about how the place you were born can kind of shape your identity, even if tangentially? For instance, I've seen the city I was born in become quite well-known over time for its urban regeneration and a couple of natural phenomena, and it's so odd to see tourists snapping pics where I used to just walk my dog. Kind of makes me proud, but also a little protective, y'know? Like, that's my stomping ground youâ€™re all Instagramming! How about you lot? Does anyone else feel a certain way when their sleepy little spot or even a bustling hometown hits the headlines or travel brochures? Share those tales!
