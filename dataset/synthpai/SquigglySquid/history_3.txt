Question: For those who've seen their neighborhoods change over the years, what's the quirkiest change you've experienced?

Question description: I remember the days my buddies and I would wander into the local fish and chip shop that had the best battered oysters you could dream of. Fast forward a bit, and it's now a vegan joint that does jackfruit "steaks". My old watering hole turned into a yoga studio, believe it or not. Mind you, the air's cleaner now than in the heyday of backyard burn-offs, so not all change is bad. Have you noticed any funky or even baffling transformations around your stomping grounds?
