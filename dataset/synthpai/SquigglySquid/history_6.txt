Question: What local urban myth or legend still captivates the folks in your area?

Question description: so i was chatting with some friends last night and one brought up this story of a ghost that supposedly haunts an old building downtown. everyone had a laugh but it's crazy how many people still avoid that place, even though it's been debunked a bunch of times. It got me thinking... does your town have a legend or an urban myth that's alive and well? like, that kinda story that's just good enough to make you doubt, or watch your back when you walk past "that" place. would love to hear what spooky tales get whispered about!
