Question: Apartment dwellers, how do you deal with the quirks of living so close to others?

Question description: so ive been living in this flat for a bit, and recently got new neighbours. they're alright, but their dog has this super weird loud bark that sounds like a person saying "hello" in a really hoarse voice. scared the bejeezus out of me the first night I heard it, not gonna lie. made me think there's a ghost or smth lurking around lol. got me thinking though, everyone who's lived in an apartment's got some weird or funny story to tell about their neighbours or thin walls. what's your wild story from living stacked up like canned sardines?
