Question: Has your perspective on relationships changed as you've matured, and if so, how?

Question description: i've been thinking a lot about how my views on relationships have shifted over time. back in my 20s, it was all about that rush of new love, y'know? now, after going through a whirlwind and watching a marriage transition from ‘till death do us part’ to signing divorce papers... it’s kinda made me more pragmatic, but in a bitter-sweet way, i guess. these days, it’s more about deep connection and stability for me rather than the fireworks. curious if anyone else has noticed a shift in their 'relationship goals' as they’ve racked up more trips around the sun?
