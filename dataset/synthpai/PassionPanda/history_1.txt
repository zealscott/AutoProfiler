Question: How has the concept of "home" changed for you as you've grown older or moved around?

Question description: lately been thinking about how when I was a kid, "home" was just where my fam was. now, after shuffling around for work and settling in a huge city that's very different from where I grew up, it's kinda wild how my feeling of what home is has changed. for starters, I find comfort in the busy streets and the fusion of cultures, even though my pay isn’t exactly sky high and living alone can be tough sometimes. plus, the idea that I could pack up and relocate if I wanted to – that's new. does anyone else feel like their understanding of "home" has evolved? what's made it change for you?
