Question: Ever looked up and noticed more cranes than birds? How's the changing skyline affecting your view... or vibe?

Question description: no big surprise, buildings are shooting up faster than you can say 'gentrification'. where i am, you see more cranes lately than you do birds. it's a mix of feelings tbh, kinda missing the old views, but also the new coffee place ain't half bad. does anyone else miss the old rooftops or is the view from the shiny new high-rise where it's at now?
