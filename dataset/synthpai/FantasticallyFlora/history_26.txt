Question: Does the 'middle class squeeze' affect your quality of life and aspirations? 

Question description: Been noticing more conversations around the dinner table about how the 'middle class squeeze' is affecting friends and fam â€“ you know, where prices and housing costs skyrocket but salaries crawl. Personally, finding it a bit of a juggle to keep up the lifestyle that was pretty standard for our parents. Think holidays, dining out, even the odd splurge. Can't help but smile thinking back to dreams of owning that vacation home, now it's more like fantasizing about the next budget-friendly staycation, am I right? How's the squeeze playing out for you? Got any smart coping strategies or had to dial back the dreams a bit?
