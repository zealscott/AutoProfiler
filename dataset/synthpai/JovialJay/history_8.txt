Question: What's an unexpected way your job has changed your daily habits or lifestyle?

Question description: So, here's a funny story. My job has me focussing a lot on sustainability, right? The other day I instinctively started lecturing my barista on the benefits of compostable cups! Embarrassing, I know, but it got me thinking... has anyone else found that their profession has started to seep into their daily life in unexpected ways? Whether it's the lingo you use, the way you think about problems, or even the coffee you drink â€“ what are some ways your job has played a part in reshaping your routine or habits?
