Question: In what quirky or unexpected ways has your degree or field of study shown up in your everyday life? 

Question description: so, funny story - I’m deep into physics, right? which you’d think doesn’t have much to do with, say, whipping up a meal. but there I was, explaining the Maillard reaction and its effects on flavor and texture to my slightly confused but intrigued dinner guests. got me thinking how often we stumble upon our field of studies in day-to-day convos or activities without even realizing it. For the sports science peeps, do you find yourself analyzing people's workouts at the gym? Or if you’re into lit, are you the go-to person for book recommendations? How does your specialized knowledge pop into your normal life?
