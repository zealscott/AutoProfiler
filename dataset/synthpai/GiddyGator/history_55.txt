Question: If your degree had a "real-world" survival rating, what would it be?

Question description: okay hear me out, i was watching some post-apocalyptic movie last night (ya know the type where everything goes kaboom and there's like 1 savvy person who knows how to fix a radio or smthn) and i started thinking... if things really hit the fan, how useful would our degrees actually be? like i studied physics and sometimes wonder how much of it would help me or anyone else if we suddenly had to, idk, start from scratch? sure, understanding the fundamental laws of nature is cool and all, but can it help me grow a potato or fix a generator? would love to hear your takes on this and if there's something you learned during your studies that could come in handy when the unlikely dystopian future becomes today's problem.
