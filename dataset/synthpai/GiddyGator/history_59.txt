Physics seemed like laying down tracks straight to academia/research; ended up diversifying plenty though! Encountered detours into industry gigs where abstract theory met hardware hiccupsâ€“sometimes felt more like taming wild variables than tracing elegant equations! Anyone else start niche but end up juggling multiple hats?
