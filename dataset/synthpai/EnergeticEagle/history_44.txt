Question: How has your profession influenced your worldview or philosophy of life? 

Question description: it's kind of crazy how what we do for a living can totally reshape the way we see things. i'm always among stars (metaphorically speaking cuz I teach astrophysics), and it really humbles you, knowing you're just this tiny speck in the cosmos. makes the daily grind seem a little less...grindy, i guess. lol, but that's just me being all starry-eyed. what about you folks? has your job or career path given you a new perspective or philosophy on life? any cool stories or shifts in thinking to share?
