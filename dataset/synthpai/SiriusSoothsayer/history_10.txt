Question: How does your income stack up to the cost of living in your area and how does it affect your lifestyle? 

Question description: you know, with the cost of everything going nuts these days, I caught myself wondering if I'm the only one whose income is a crazy rollercoaster ride when it comes to matching up with living costs. feels like one minute you're on top of your budget and the next, you’re cutting coupons like there's no tomorrow. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m not struggling, but definitely had to skip a few luxuries to keep up with the bills and still save for those rainy days. How’s it going for you? Is your income doing its job keeping up with the living costs, or are you having to invent new ways to stretch a dollar?
