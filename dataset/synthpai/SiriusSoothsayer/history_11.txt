Question: Has anyone else experienced lifestyle creep with higher income? What’s your story to keeping or losing the simple life?

Question description: isn't it wild how we adapt to our income levels? back in the day, i was all about the simple things, thrift shops and budget-friendly hangouts, but since moving up in the world, i’ve noticed the fancy dinners and brand names creeping in. kinda miss the simpler times though - it felt like life was less complicated or maybe that's just nostalgia? but a part of me wonders if i could go back to living that way without feeling like i'm missing out. has anyone managed to keep it simple even after a pay rise, or have you embraced the change? share your tales, i'm super curious!
