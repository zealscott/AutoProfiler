Question: Singles of Reddit, how does your city treat those flying solo? 

Question description: It seems like every place has got its own vibe when it comes to singles. where i'm at, there's a ton of stuff geared towards families and couples. feels like every time i hit the beach, or even the new art installations downtown, i'm dodging prams and "save the date" photo shoots. sometimes the scene is super supportive of the solo lifestyle, but other days, not so much. anyone else find the city living experience differs when you’re on your own? what's cool about being single where you are, or what’s the city like for those not in a duo?
