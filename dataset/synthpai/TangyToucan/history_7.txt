Question: Has a profession ever caused a rift in your personal relationships? If so, how did you navigate through it?

Question description: i’ve been thinking a lot lately about how we balance our work and personal lives... got heavy into this convo over dinner with friends the other night. personally, my job can be super intense, once had a partner who just didn't get the whole "work late, grade papers, and prep research" lifestyle, ended up feeling super disconnected. we split, but it was rough. know it's not just me – someone else out there must've had their work life bleed into their personal space, right? spill the beans, what went down and how'd you handle it?
