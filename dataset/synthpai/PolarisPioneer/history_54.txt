Question: How did you know you were ready to take the next step in your relationship? 

Question description: so, my partner just surprised me with tickets to this escape room with a "Will You..." puzzle at the end - talk about creative proposals, right? got me thinking bout how everyone's got their moment that clicks, like "yeah, this is the person i wanna level up with." for me, it was realising we could talk about literally anything, from how many marshmallows is too many in hot chocolate to the nitty-gritty of our career goals, without missing a beat. what about y'all? was there an epic moment or something super chill that just made it crystal clear it was time to go from just chilling to putting a ring on it or moving in together or whatever your next step was?
