Question: How much does the weather influence your daily mood and productivity?

Question description: This might be a bit out there, but do you ever feel like your whole vibe for the day gets set by what you see outside your window first thing in the morning? For example, here we get these wild temperature swings sometimes â€“ you're going to sleep with a chilly night and suddenly next day feels like someone cranked the thermostat. It throws me off completely, makes me wanna just camp out at a coffee shop with my laptop and chill instead of doing anything major. How about you? Do you get that urge to hibernate when it's cold or does a sunny day make you want to conquer the world?
