Question: How has your perception of gender roles changed as you've matured?

Question description: Back in the day, it felt like there were super strict rules on what it meant to "be a man" or "be a woman", but times are changing and so did my view. Funny thing is, it took some quirky hobbies and a bunch of years to realize that. Picked up knitting recently - yep, you heard that right - and it's been a blast and a big eye-opener. No one batted an eye, which was cool and really different from the old days. Made me wonder how others have seen these roles evolve over time, and what's your story? Did you break any "gender rule" that you're particularly proud of?
