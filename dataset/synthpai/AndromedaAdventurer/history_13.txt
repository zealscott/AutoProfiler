Question: Singles of Reddit, how has being unattached influenced your personal growth and hobbies?

Question description: so here's the thing, since i've been riding solo, i've noticed my interests evolving in unexpected ways. used to be all about going out, trying to impress, you know the drill. but lately, something's changed. i’ve fallen back in love with music, expanding my horizons way beyond what i ever expected. picked up the guitar, started writing tunes, even thought about sharing them online. on the flip side, some of my mates seem to be all about that relationship life, and their hobbies took a backseat. it got me wondering – others flying solo – have you found yourself diving deeper into hobbies or finding new ones because of your relationship status? what's your passion project right now?
