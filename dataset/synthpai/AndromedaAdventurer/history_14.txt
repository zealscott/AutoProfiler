Question: Singles of Reddit, how do you respond to the "When are you going to settle down?" question at family gatherings? 

Question description: Being happily single has its peaks. Like, a lot of freedom and extra cash for hobbies. Buut, every family gathering, there's always that one relative or, heck, even a close friend who drops the "when are you settling down?" bomb. Got me thinking about how others handle this. Do you guys have a go-to witty comeback, or do you get into deep philosophical explanations about modern love and individualism? Share the tactics you use to parry those well-meaning, but kinda personal probes.
