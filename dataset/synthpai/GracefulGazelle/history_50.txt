Question: How has your gender influenced your career or education choices?

Question description: Was scrolling through some old college pics and remembered the time I almost switched my major because of a silly belief that I wouldn't 'fit in' due to my gender. Ended up sticking to my guns and here I am, years later, happy with my choice but I keep wondering... do others have similar tales? Did you pursue or avoid a certain path because of gender norms? Or maybe were encouraged to take a leap despite them? Would love to hear how your experiences unfolded.
