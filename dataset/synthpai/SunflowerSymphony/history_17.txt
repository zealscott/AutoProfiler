Question: How has the vibe of your birth city shaped who you are today?

Question description: grew up in this lovely historic city, not too huge but full of life, culture, and a certain gruff charm that I always think gave me my resilience and love for stories. it's weird how the energy of a place can kinda seep into you, isn't it? like, I can handle pretty much anything at work, and I reckon it's that early taste of a community that wasn't always polished but was real, y'know? what about you guys, do you feel like your hometown's spirit has worked its way into your personality or life choices?
