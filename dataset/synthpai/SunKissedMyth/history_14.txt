history 14
i hear ya - grew up around boats n' nets myself. had its charm but life wasn’t all calm seas and sunny shores if ya catch my drift? even after years out at sea everytime i see those familiar coastlines it feels nostalgic yet always reminds me that progress doesn’t mean forgetting our roots, just learning from 'em!
