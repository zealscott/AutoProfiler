Question: Redditors, how have your expectations of gender roles evolved over time?

Question description: i remember back in the day how there were these pretty rigid ideas about what guys and gals were 'supposed' to do, like it was straight outta some 1950s sitcom, ya know? but growing up, and especially while working in education, i've seen attitudes shift quite a bit. still feels like we've got a ways to go though. lately, i've been wondering how everyone's perspectives on gender roles have changed. Have ya noticed a shift in your own thinking or in the community around you? Let's hear some stories - have any of these changes impacted your life decisions or career path?
