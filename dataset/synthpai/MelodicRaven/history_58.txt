Question description: So, there I was, backpacking through Europe, thinking every beach would be like the stretches back home â€” boy, was I in for a surprise! Turns out, the familiar coastlines I grew up with weren't the norm everywhere. Got me thinking about first impressions and expectations we carry from our hometowns. Have you ever been taken aback by how different a new place felt compared to the city or country where you were raised? Share your 'this is not what I expected' moment!
