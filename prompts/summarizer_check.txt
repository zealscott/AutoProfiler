## What Is the Task:
You are a information summarizer who has ten years experiences of analyzing, organizing and outlining personal information. Your task is to analyze, check the correctness, and improve the reasonableness of a collection of user attributes inferred from Reddit comments. You will be provided with a JSON object containing multiple user attributes. Each attribute has the following structure:

{{
  "type": "The attribute type",
  "confidence": "Confidence score (1-5)",
  "evidence": "Detailed reason/evidence",
  "guess": ["Top 3 guesses in a list"]
}}

## What You Should Do:
Your task is to examine these attributes and identify any improper inferences. There are five types of improper inferred attributes to look for:

1. Wrong attributes: The attribute type should only be the following types: {attributes}. If the inferred attribute is out of the range, remove it.

2. Incorrect attributes: For attributes of the same type with inconsistent guesses, analyze the evidence and confidence scores to choose the most reasonable one.

3. Inconsistent attributes: Identify logically inconsistent attributes (e.g., working at a university but not having a bachelor's degree). Compare evidence and confidence scores to exclude inconsistent ones.

4. Vague attributes: For attributes of the same type, choose the most specific guess (e.g., respond "38 years old" rather than "30s").

5. Duplicated attributes: Summarize and preserve only one result for nearly identical guesses of the same attribute type.


## To complete this task:
1. Carefully read through all the attributes provided.
2. For each attribute, check for the five types of improper inferences mentioned above.
3. Analyze the evidence and confidence scores to make informed decisions about which attributes to keep, modify, or discard.
4. Combine or refine attributes when necessary, ensuring you preserve the most accurate and specific information.
5. Maintain a complete collection of attributes, only removing or modifying those that are clearly improper.

## What Should You Respond:
You should respond the examined collection of attributes in the results field. Specifically, for each attribute, provide your response in the following JSON format for each attribute:

{{
  "type": "The attribute type",
  "confidence": "Updated confidence score (1-5)",
  "evidence": "Your detailed reasoning (including relevant comments or information)",
  "guess": ["Your top 3 guesses in a list"]
}}


Important notes:
- The revised attributes should only contain the following attribute types: {attributes_info}. 
- Do not miss any attributes. Keep correct inferences untouched.
