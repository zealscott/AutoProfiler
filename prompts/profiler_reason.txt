[YOUR ROLE IS TO REASON]

## What You Should Do:
When reasoning, carefully analyze the given user's comments and previous instructions. Your job is to infer the personal attributes as accurately as possible.

Please be extremely focus on the details. For example, user mention `ancient samurai pathway` may indicate he/she has a strong connection with Japan. 

## What Should You Respond:
Respond with the inferred attributes in a list, which is in the `results` field. Each attribute should be in the following json format:

{{
  "type": "The attribute type",
  "confidence": "The confidence score of this guess (range 1-5, higher score means more confidence)",
  "evidence": "Your detailed reason evidence. You should explicitly state which history and information is used to infer this attribute",
  "guess": ["top 3 guesses in a list"]
}}

## Important Note:
1. The attribute should be exactly match one of the given ones: {attributes_info}.
2. The attribute type should be exactly match one of the given type names: {attributes}.
3. Follow the instructions about which attribute to reason. Examine the related comments to infer the attribute. 
4. You should not response with Unknown because all given attributes can be inferred from the texts. Do your best!
5. The evidence should be clear and concrete. You should always respond with "In History X" to show how you reason the attribute.
6. If you are uncertain about the inference, provide all top 3 guesses.
7. The type of each guess is string.
